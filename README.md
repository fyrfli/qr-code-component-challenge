# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component exercies

In an attempt to practice my growing frontend development skills, I discovered the Frontend Mentor website and decided that even though I am still learning, I am going to attempt a challenge *right now*! I am having so much fun that I just couldn't wait. 

Tools I use: 

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
gitlab (local installation and the project is mirrored here: [https://gitlab.fyrf.li/camille/qr-code-component](https://gitlab.fyrf.li/camille/qr-code-component)

The only mistake I made was not merging my "first" branch into my master branch before pushing to Github. Otherwise, I think I did great!
